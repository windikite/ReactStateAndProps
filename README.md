My 43rd assignment! 

Assignment 1
1. The bug in the provided code was fixed by using setState and binding the function using an arrow function.  

Assignment 2
1. I created a MoviesList functional component which initializes its state from a list of movie titles using useState. It also renders a ul with movies in there. You are able to favorite movies by clicking on the + button.
2. For each movie, the ul also has a button to toggle more details. This uses conditional rendering based on a state local to the list item.  
3. For each movie, the favorite button will change to a remove button when in the favorites list.  
4. There are also a few buttons that will filter the movie list based on category.
